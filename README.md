# reanimator
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/reanimator

I wanted to update this to more recent C#, refactor and rewrite aspects of it, and correct some of the issues noted by the original developer.  In addition, the original UI could use some ease-of-use adjustments.

I know some of you are asking why I would want to spend the time to do this, especially since the code works.  Well, my answer to you is, "Why did people climb Mount Everest?  Because it was there."  No code--especially code that has sat untouched as long as this has--is ever perfect, and it can always do with some updating and fixing.

Feel free to contribute if you want.
